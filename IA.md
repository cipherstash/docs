# Docs V2 — Information Architecture & migration checklist

Living checklist for the docs overhaul. Tracked in Linear under
[CIP-3307](https://linear.app/cipherstash/issue/CIP-3307); the full IA rationale
(design principles, audience doors, correctness strategy) lives in
`CipherStash docs IA v1.md` in the content repo. **Tick items here as they land
on the `v2` branch.** Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[x]` done · 🚧 stub exists · ⛔ blocked
on a product decision (see CIP-3307 checklist).

## How this branch works

- New IA lives in `content/docs`, served from the site root (`/docs/<section>/…`).
- The legacy tree (`content/stack`) is served alongside it at `/docs/stack/…`
  until every section migrates, then deleted (CIP-3335).
- The full legacy→v2 redirect map is `v2-redirects.mjs`, gated behind
  `ENABLE_V2_REDIRECTS=1` (flipped on at merge). `bun run validate-redirects`
  enforces that every legacy page has a mapping.
- Frontmatter facets (`type`, `components`, `audience`, `integration`,
  `verifiedAgainst`, `reviewBy`) are defined in `source.config.ts` (`v2docs`).
- **Moving a page** = move the file into `content/docs`, update its facets,
  fix inbound links, confirm its `v2-redirects.mjs` entry, tick it here.

## URL conventions

Lowercase, hyphens, no trailing slashes, no version numbers in paths.
Integrations are **flat** (no category segment). Error pages (future, miette)
live at `/docs/errors/<code>` — permanent, never restructured (CIP-3338).

## Content model — two axes

The migration checklist below tracks _what_ moves; this section fixes _where
things go and why_, so placement stops being re-litigated per PR.

### Terms

- **Mode** — what the reader is trying to do. The four Diátaxis kinds
  (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation), plus our three audience doors
  (integrations, solutions, security) which serve the same placement role.
  A page has exactly one mode; the mode decides its sidebar home.
- **Component** — a layer of the product stack, drawn from the `components`
  facet enum: `encryption` (Stack SDK), `platform` (CTS + ZeroKMS), `eql`,
  `proxy`, `cli`. A page can touch several components at once.
- **Facet** — structured frontmatter that classifies a page along one axis
  (`type`, `components`, `audience`, `integration`). Queryable; never shown
  raw to users; independent of nav position.
- **Hub** — a per-component page at `/components/<component>` that gathers
  every page tagged with that component. A generated view, not a subtree.
  Not every component has a hub: hubs are for _layers_ of the stack
  (`encryption`, `platform`, `eql`, `proxy`). `cli` is a component but a
  cross-cutting tool, not a layer, so it has no hub.
- **Locator** — the one hand-written paragraph (plus mini stack diagram) at the
  top of a hub, orienting the reader: what the component is, what sits above and
  below it. Prose, nothing else.

### The rule

**The sidebar is organized only by mode. The by-component view lives only on the hubs.**

CipherStash is a dependency stack, not a set of independent product pillars:
integrations sit on the Stack SDK and Proxy, both consume EQL, and EQL sits on
the Platform (CTS + ZeroKMS). That is a graph. A sidebar is a tree. So we split
the two axes rather than forcing the graph into the tree.

- **Mode axis (the tree).** Every page has exactly one home, chosen by _what the
  reader is doing_: Diátaxis mode (`get-started`, `guides`, `reference`,
  `concepts`) plus three audience doors (`integrations`, `solutions`,
  `security`). The sidebar is built from `meta.json` and nothing else.
- **Component axis (the graph).** Which layers a page touches is the `components`
  facet — never a sidebar section. The dependency graph is expressed by facets
  and surfaced by hub pages, so a shared layer like EQL is documented once and
  referenced everywhere.

Why the pillar layouts (Supabase, Clerk, GitHub) don't transfer: those are
feature-pillar products whose parts are independent, so each pillar can be its
own subtree. Our parts are layers in a dependency stack — a shared layer has no
single natural parent, so it cannot be a tree node without duplication.

### Placement test

Two questions, in this order, for every page:

1. _Which mode is this?_ → decides the folder (its one sidebar home).
2. _Which components does it touch?_ → sets the `components` facet.

Never the reverse. If you are tempted to file a page _under_ a component, that is
the signal to file it by mode and tag the component instead.

### Invariants

- The sidebar tree is `meta.json` only. Facets never affect nav position
  (already asserted by the schema comment in `source.config.ts`).
- A page appears in exactly one place in the tree. Cross-cutting reuse happens
  through links and hubs, never by duplicating a page under a second parent.
- Shared mechanics have exactly one canonical page; every other page links,
  never restates. This generalises the existing EQL rule (mechanics live in
  `/reference/eql/core-concepts`; category pages link to it) to every component.
- Each component has exactly one hub at `/components/<component>`. A hub is a
  facet-driven _view_: it links to canonical pages and owns no mechanics.
- `/get-started/what-is-cipherstash` renders the components map; its nodes link
  to the hubs. The hubs are the _only_ component-first surface, and they hold no
  primary content — so they do not recreate the legacy component-first tree
  (the old `root: true` Encryption/KMS/Proxy/Platform tabs).

#### A note on hub URLs

Hubs live at the top-level path `/components/<component>` for a short, memorable
front door, but are anchored in the sidebar under Get started (Fumadocs takes
nav position from `meta.json` independently of the URL). If you would rather the
URL mirror the nav, use `/get-started/components/<component>` instead — either
works; pick one and add it to `v2-redirects.mjs`.

### Sidebar

Mode-first, seven top-level sections. `compare` is folded into `concepts` (each
comparison already belongs to a door: aws-kms and vault are security-review
material, fhe and rls-and-tde are concepts). Component hubs are anchored under
Get started, not given their own top-level tab.

### Hub pages

One per component, at `/components/<component>`. Same template every time:

1. **Locator** — one paragraph plus the stack diagram with this layer
   highlighted: what it is, what it sits on, what sits on it.
2. **Start here** — the one or two canonical entry pages.
3. **By mode** — grouped links (Concepts · Guides · Reference · Security ·
   Integrations that use it). Every entry links to its canonical mode-home.
4. Nothing else. No mechanics, no examples that live elsewhere.

The "By mode" lists are generated, not hand-maintained: filter
`source.getPages()` to pages whose `components` facet includes this component,
then group by `type`. "Integrations that use it" is the subset whose frontmatter
also carries an `integration` block. This is why the facet earns its keep — the
hubs cost nothing to maintain once a page is correctly tagged.

**Tagging rule — `eql` is conditional, not automatic.** Stack encrypts values
in three modes: general-purpose (a value in your app), Postgres columns, and
non-Postgres stores like DynamoDB. Only the Postgres path involves EQL. So tag
`eql` only when the page is actually about queryable-in-Postgres ciphertext.
General-purpose and DynamoDB pages are `components: [encryption, platform]` with
_no_ `eql` — DynamoDB (`encryptedDynamoDB`) is the canonical no-EQL example and
the reason "Stack depends on EQL" is wrong. EQL is the Postgres searchability
layer, not a layer every Stack page sits on.

#### Stack SDK — `/components/stack-sdk`  (facet: `encryption`)

- Locator: the TypeScript SDK; encrypt and decrypt values in your app. Sits on
  the Platform. Add EQL when the data lives in Postgres and you want the
  ciphertext queryable there — but Stack also encrypts general-purpose values
  and non-Postgres stores (e.g. DynamoDB) with no EQL at all.
- Start here: Quickstart · Reference → Stack SDK (client + configuration)
- Concepts: application-level encryption · searchable encryption · identity-aware encryption
- Guides: schema design · encrypt existing data · testing & CI · serverless & bundling
- Reference: `/reference/stack/*` (schema · encrypt-decrypt · supabase · drizzle-operators · errors)
- Security: `/security/stack-sdk`
- Integrations (auto): Supabase · Drizzle · Prisma · DynamoDB · Next.js …

#### Proxy — `/components/proxy`  (facet: `proxy`)

- Locator: the no-app-changes path; sits in front of Postgres and speaks EQL for you.
- Start here: Reference → Proxy (configuration) · Guides → Proxy deployment
- Concepts: application-level encryption · searchable encryption
- Guides: proxy deployment · going to production
- Reference: `/reference/proxy/*` (configuration · message-flow · multitenant · errors)
- Security: `/security/proxy`
- Integrations (auto): AWS RDS/Aurora · Docker
- See also: EQL hub (shared dependency)

#### EQL — `/components/eql`  (facet: `eql`)  ← the shared spine

- Locator: the Postgres searchability layer. Makes ciphertext queryable in
  Postgres by declaring an encrypted column's capability in the schema. The
  Proxy always speaks EQL; the Stack SDK uses it only on its Postgres path (not
  for general-purpose or DynamoDB encryption).
- Start here: Reference → EQL (install) · EQL core-concepts
- Concepts: EQL (typed-column model) · searchable encryption (leakage model)
- Reference: the whole `/reference/eql/*` tree
- Guides: troubleshooting → query performance
- Consumed by: Proxy hub (always) · Stack SDK hub (Postgres path only)
- Anti-drift: mechanics live in `/reference/eql/core-concepts`; this hub links only.

#### Platform — `/components/platform`  (facet: see vocab note)  ← the foundation

- Locator: the base everything relies on — key management (ZeroKMS) and identity-bound access (CTS).
- Start here: Security → Architecture · Concepts → Key management
- Concepts: key management · identity-aware encryption
- Reference: `/reference/auth/*` (lock-contexts · cts-tokens · oidc · access-keys)
- Security: architecture · zerokms · cts · availability · audit logging · key ownership
- Integrations (auto): Clerk · Auth0 · Okta

### Worked example: how auth fits

Auth is the concern most likely to feel like it needs its own section — it spans
the SDK, the Proxy, local dev, the Platform, and every auth provider. It doesn't
get one. It's the case that shows the model absorbing a cross-cutting concern
without bending: auth isn't a _layer_, it's a concern that shows up _on_ layers,
so it lives as facets and links, never as a tree section or a hub.

"Auth" names several distinct things. Keep them separate:

| Thing | What it is | `components` | Canonical home |
|---|---|---|---|
| CTS | Identity service in the Platform | `platform` | `/security/cts`, `/reference/auth/*` |
| `@cipherstash/auth` | Stack package (identity-aware encryption) | `[encryption, platform]` | `/reference/stack/auth` |
| Proxy stack-auth | How auth works inside the Proxy | `[proxy, platform]` | `/reference/proxy/*`, `/security/proxy` |
| Next.js adapter | Framework integration | `[encryption, platform]` | `/integrations/nextjs` |
| Clerk / Auth0 / Okta | Auth-provider integrations | `[platform]` | `/integrations/*` (`category: auth-provider`) |

None of these is filed under an "auth" section, because there isn't one. Each is
filed by _mode_ (service → Security/Reference, package → Reference, providers →
Integrations) and tagged by _component_. The through-line is reassembled by
queries, not by a subtree:

- The Platform hub gathers all of it — everything above carries `platform`.
- Faceted search on `integration.category: auth-provider` gives the providers.
- `/concepts/identity-aware-encryption` is the one explanatory page that ties the
  concept together in prose; everything else links to it (anti-drift rule).

Naming caution: `/reference/auth/*` means the CTS _service_; the `@cipherstash/auth`
_package_ lives at `/reference/stack/auth`. Two different things both called
"auth" — keep the paths distinct so contributors don't merge them.

The `components` facet enum is `[encryption, platform, eql, proxy, cli]`
(collapsing the former `auth` and `zerokms` into a single `platform`, matching
the product story "Platform = CTS + ZeroKMS"). This maps 1:1 onto the hubs:
`encryption` → Stack SDK, `platform`, `eql`, `proxy`.

Two notes:

- The `encryption` facet value and its hub title **Stack SDK** differ on
  purpose — the facet names the capability, the hub names the product. Document
  once, move on.
- Collapsing `auth`/`zerokms` into `platform` means you can't isolate the
  CTS/identity pages by facet query anymore — a `platform` query returns all of
  Platform. That distinction still lives in nav location (`/security/cts` vs
  `/security/zerokms`) and in `integration.category: auth-provider` for the
  Clerk/Auth0/Okta pages, so it isn't lost — it just isn't on the `components`
  axis.
